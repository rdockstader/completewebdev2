            <p>Jon is a person that puts his entire heart and soul into all that he does. And this is no different for his business/hobby, Vintage snowmobile curation and selling. Going from the stock of just a couple of snowmobiles, to now having a stock of quite a few sleds, as well as a full stock of vintage helmets, and snowmobiling gear.</p>
            <h2 class="main-page-header">About Jon</h2>
            <p>Jon grew up in Cache Valley, specifically in the city of Smithfield. His parents taught him to love the outdoors, and especially love snowmobiling. From a young age, his family owned snowmobiles, fixed snowmobiles and rode snowmobiles every chance they got. As he grew up he aquired his own snowmobiles by working with his Dad, on a Candy delivery route. He now has a wife, and three children and a few more snowmobiles. Jon loves sharing his  passion for snowmobiling to everyone he can, and loves giving people the oportunity to break into the snowmobiling hobby at the lowest expense to them possible. He also enjoys helping people complete their vintage snowmobile collection. </p>
